# Site

This is a basic HTML/CSS/JS site!

## Getting Started

We're going to use the PHP development server locally to serve our files and documents.  Of course there are many ways to do this, but this is fastest and requires the least setup on OS-X.  Yeah!

Navigate to the directory which contains your files, and start the PHP local server:  (note that this may need to be tailored to your particular environment / directory naming convention)

```
cd ~/gits/site
php -S localhost:8080
```

Now fire up your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/].  You should see your directory index.
